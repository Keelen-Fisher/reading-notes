What is **Growth Mindset**?

Growth mindset is the approach of my daily lifestyle (with challenges, trails, activities and areas of conflict) by encouraging myself to always improve myself.

What are some reminders in order to stay in a growth mindset:

- Any phrases that you create within your mind that establishes negativity by saying that "you can't do something" or "you're not who you are supposed to be", place in a **"yet"** afterwards.
- The minute that you start to give up and let go of your ambition, is the minute that you truly lose. You are going to miss the mark on some tasks but that does not mean that you can't try to find the mark again.
- Just because you lose doesn't mean that you are lost **forever**.

### Bio:
Born and raised in Houston Texas, with my family being from Trinidad and Tobago; there were two things in life that facinated me from a kid to a yound man, that was the meaning of success and becoming a hero. I enjoy many things such as fitness, music, art, cooking, sports and reading, but the ability to create a legacy which can be passed down from one generation to another while showing that the impossible is possible was always my goal in life. From there, I ventured into many career paths. From Electrical Engineering, to Environmental Science, to Persoanl Training! Finally, to Computer Science. Now, I want to lead a path of aspiring futurists into a world of technical evolution through programming languages, while providing for my family. I aim to complete this curriculum and finish my journey making the world better, a stronger family, and with satisfaction.
