## Understanding git:

### What Exactly Is It?
- A way to keep track of your projects throught each stage of them
- Multiple developers can work on the same code and records the history of our changes 
- A way to share code and collaboration 
- dvcs (Distrinuted version control system)
>### So basically, it's like having **ALL** of your saved files and workings in one repository!!
- You are also able to keep track of your save states through saving and creating messages in each commit (or snapshot) 
- The *head* , means that you are currently saved on this state right now. 

## Understanding GitHub:
- **NOT** a git
- You can share code with other developers 

## Repository:
- It is a collection of files within git and GitHub
- Keep your projects ***SEPERATED!***
- Every time that you make a new repository, go to settings and save first to create the web url, then choose theme
