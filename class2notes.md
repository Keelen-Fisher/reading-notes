	- Creating Terminal Tasks:
		○ PWD (Print Working Directory) [Where am I command] after you press enter, it should display your current location. (In which folder?) 
		○ Command: LS (List) Listing all of the directory items. (What's in this folder?)
		○ Cd (Change Directory) 
			§ So if I want to change the directory, type: cd [Enter directory or beginning letter of it] then enter tab (Don’t forget that!!
		○ EX:
			§ Cd codefellows-work
			§ Codefellows-work pwd
			§ Codefellows-work ls
		○ Mkdir: Make new Directions 
		○ How do we go back? Enter your periods. The number the periods they are, the farther you go back. 
		○ What does argument mean? Means that it is a request of a new line.

			§ EX: touch hiclass.md (after you press enter in the terminal, a file will pop up in the file explorer

		○ Emmet Abbreviation: options that you can choose (Like a template) 
			§ EX: when you type in html, and there's an option that pops up <html></html>
