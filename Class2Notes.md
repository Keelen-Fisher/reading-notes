# Class 2 Notes
>## What is Markdown? 
- A lightweight markup language for generating files, so customizing your text and structure in your website. Overall, markdown is the first step in creating webpages through github.
From headings to paragraphs and images, markdown utilizes basic syntax to develop the template! 

### Keep in Mind: 
- The spacing and organization is just as important as using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

> A few strong syntax's to remember:
- Three asterisks can create text with bold and italic
- The number sign (or hashtag) must be spaced from the text
- Make sure that the ordered list is not through a parenthesis, but with a period.
- Images could be used and displayed in many ways, one of the easier options is to drag an image from your file explorer to display the image.
