## My **Growth Mindset**
>What is it?



Growth mindset is the approach of my daily lifestyle (with challenges, trails, activities and areas of conflict) by encouraging myself to always improve myself.

What are some reminders in order to stay in a growth mindset:

- Any phrases that you create within your mind that establishes negativity by saying that "you can't do something" or "you're not who you are supposed to be", place in a **"yet"** afterwards.
- The minute that you start to give up and let go of your ambition, is the minute that you truly lose. You are going to miss the mark on some tasks but that does not mean that you can't try to find the mark again.
- Just because you lose doesn't mean that you are lost **forever**. 

## What is Markdown? 
- A lightweight markup language for generating files, so customizing your text and structure in your website. Overall, markdown is the first step in creating webpages through github.
From headings to paragraphs and images, markdown utilizes basic syntax to develop the template! 

### Keep in Mind: 
- The spacing and organization is just as important as using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

> A few strong syntax's to remember:
- Three asterisks can create text with bold and italic
- The number sign (or hashtag) must be spaced from the text
- Make sure that the ordered list is not through a parenthesis, but with a period.
- Images could be used and displayed in many ways, one of the easier options is to drag an image from your file explorer to display the image.
